# EU INSTITUTIONS

The European Union is made up of **28** Member states. Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway are EFTA members that add to the EU to make the EEA.

The EU's institutions are:

* the European Council (institutional status)
* the European Parliament
* 'the Council' of the EU (Council of Ministers)
* the European Commission
* the Court of Justice of the European Union
* the European Central Bank (institutional status)
* the Court of Auditors

The ones with 'institutional status' can make binding decisions, as opposed to just being advisors.

# European Council _(Institutional Status)_
Formed in 1974 and formalized in 1992, it is a forum where Heads of State can discuss issues affecting the community. It meets four times a year to define the EU's priorities and set it's political direction.

# The European Parliament
This is the only European Institution whose members are elected by the citizens of the EU. It has four responsibilities:

1. Legislative development (codecision, consultation, cooperation or assent, but _not_ proposing new legislation)
   a. **Codecision** - Parliament and the Council must assent to the legislation
   b. **Consultation** - The Council must consult the Parliament, but is not bound by its opinion
   c. **Cooperation** - The Council shares power with the Parliament and must consult them before making a decision, unless acting unanimously.
   d. **Assent** - for important things like adding a country, the Parliament must agree

2. Supervisory oversight of the other institutions
   a. Parliament can censure the Commission, including forcing the entire College of Commissioners to resign
   b. Parliament has an Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the other institutions

3. Democratic representation
   Citizens have a right to petition Parliament to request that any problems falling within the sphere of activity of the EU be remedied

4. Development of the Budget

Elections for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are held every 5 years. All EU citizens may vote or stand as candidates. There are about 750 of them. The Parliament's main impact on privacy is through legislation.

# Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers)
Established in the 1950s, it is the main decision-making body of the EU. It is attended by one minister from each member state, with the power to commit their government. The Council shares legislative power with the European Parliament.

Legislation is generally proposed by the Commission, then examined by the Council and Parliament. The Council has the power to amend the proposal before it is adopted. Examples include international agreements.

# European Commission
Created in 1965, the commisson is the executive body of the EU, implementing its decisions and policies. Each member state has its own commissioners, who is independant of the country who proposed them, and their appointment is ratified by the Parliament.

The Commission has the ability to adopt 'adequacy findings' for third countries.

# Court of Justice of the European Union
Based in Luxembourg, the Court is the judicial body of the EU. It makes decisions on EU law, and enforces actions taken by the Commission, or by individuals under EU law. It includes the Court of Justice, General Court, and specialized courts. The ECJ hears cases brought by member states, or the European Commission, against other member states for failure to fulful treaty obligations. 

It can be confused with the EHCR, which enforces Human Rights across Europe and some non-European countries.

## European Data Protection Board (EDPB) / Article 29 Working Party
Independant advisory body composed of representatives from the EU DPAs, EDPS and European Commission. Its opinions are not legally binding, but pre-empt how the insitutions of the EU will react.

## European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)
The EDPS regulates compliance with data protection law within the institutions of the European Union, but national DPAs may also have jurisdiction in such matters.
