# Personal Data
Defined in GDPR Article 4(1) as _any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person_.

GDPR does not apply to anonyimised data. Pseudonymous data, which has had some identifying information replaced with an identifier, is still governed by GDPR.

## Special Categories of Personal Data
Defined in Article 9(1) as follows:

Personal Data revealing:
* Racial or ethnic origin
* Political opinions
* Religious or philosophical beliefs
* Trade Union Membership

For the purpose of uniely identifying a natural person:
* Genetic Data
* Biometric Data

Data Concerning:
* Health
* Sex Life 
* Sexual Orientation

Article 10 also calls out **Criminal Records**, stating that _"processing shall be carried out only under the control of official authority, or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects"_.

# Data Protection Roles
There are 4 distinct roles:
* **Data Subject** - a natural person about whom personal data is processed
* **Data Controller** - an organisation or individual who determines _'the purposes and means of processing personal data'_
* **Data Processor** - an organisation or individual who processes information on behalf of the controller. They do not exercise autonomy in deciding how the data is used and their activities must be transparent to the controller. Processing can include any operation performed on data, and does not soley apply to collection.
* **Supervisory Authority** - an entity appointed to enforce privacy in a jurisdiction

# GDPR Processing Principals
GDPR sets out the following prinipals for processing data:

* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency of processing
* Purpose limitation - using data only for the purpose it was collected
* Data minimization, storage limitation and proportionality - not collecting or keeping data that isn't necessecary for the purpose
* Accuracy
* Integrity and confidentiality - requiring security controls
* Accountability - demonstrating compliance with EU and member-state laws

## Territorial Scope 
1. When a controller or processor is established in the EU
2. When data subjects are in the EU
3. The goods or services are offered in the EU
4. Monitoring behaviour in the EU
5. Processing by a controller in a place where member state law applies by virtue of public international law

## Material Scope
Processing personal data wholly or partially by automated means (not automated decision making)
Processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system

### Exclusions from Material Scope
The following activities don't come under Material Scope, which should be interpreted narrowly:

* Activities outside the scope of EU law (eg national security activities)
* Law enforcement and public security
* Purely personal or household activities

## Legal Basis for Processing Data
Processing data is lawful if at least one of the following legal bases applies:

* **Consent** - the data subject consents to the processing of their personal data. Consent can't be used if their is a clear imbalance between the contoller and the data subject, such as between an employer and employee, or if the controller is a public authority.
* **Contractual Necessity** - Processing is needed to enter into or perform a contract
* **Legitimate Interests** - The data can be processed in ways that have a minimal privacy impact, that the data subject would reasonably expect. Examples woudl be Fraud Prevention, Direct Marketing, Administrative Purposes, etc. The controller must demonstrate that the data subjects rights have not been compromised, showing transparency, adequate safeguards and compliance. Public authorities must not rely on legitimate interests.
* **Legal Obligations** - The controller has to process data for a legal obligation
* **Public Interest** - Public authorityies and organisations in the scope of public duties can process data in ways that have been legislated
* **Vital Interests** - Data can be processed in the interest of a data subject in emergency situations where they cannot provide consent

## Processing Special Categories
Processing of special categories is prohibited, unless an exception applies:

* Explicit Consent
* In the context of Employment, to comply with a legal obligation
* Vital interests, where consent is not possible and the controller has tried to obtain it
* Political, philosophical and religious purposes - foundations, associations and not-for-profits may process data about their own members
* Sensitive data manifestly made public by the data subject
* Establishment,exercise or defence of legal claims
* Substantial public interest
* Medicine and social healthcare, such ass assessing the work capacity of an employee, making a diagnosis, etc
* Public archives, scientific, historical or statistical purposes

Again, the controller must demonstrate that the data subjects rights have not been compromised, showing transparency, adequate safeguards and compliance.

# Consent
Asking for Consent must be:
* Clearly distingishable
* Intelligible
* In clear and plain language

Consent must be:
* Freely given and unambiguous (not using silence, inactivity, pre-ticked boxes, etc)
* Informed - the subject should know hte controller's identity, purpose, and information about how processing may affect data subjects
* Withdrawing consent should be as easy as giving it
* For a specific purpose (with some flexibility for scientific research)
* given by a parent for Children's data when the subject is younger than 16. Member states can lower this age down to 13.

Controllers must keep records of consent, under the Accountability principle. A service or the performance of a contract should **not** be conditional upon consent.

# Data Subject Rights
Under GDPR these are: Access and rectification, Data portability, Erasure, Restriction of Processing, Objection to Processing, Not to be subject to a decision based soley on automated processing.

## Right to Access and Rectification
Rights like Access and rectification should be free unless the Data Subject requests multiple copies, in which case a 'reasonable' administrative charge can be applied. The controller must take reasonable steps to identify the requester. Information may be exempt if it reveals personal data of another individual, or data that is exempt from disclosure.

Data subjects may also find out IF their data has been processed, the purpose of the processing, the categories of data processed, why it was, and recipients (or categories of recipients) who recieved the data, and the retention period of the data.

Requests should be processed without undue delay, but not more than a month. A high volume of requests may allow an extension of up to two months.

## Data Portability
Data must be made exportable in a commonly used, machine-readable format. The controller must help the individual trasfer data to another organisation, including sending the data directly. This is only for electronic processing, and only for personal data collected from the data subject. It also doesn't include data derived/inferred from the data provided.

Most important: This right only applies if the processing is based on **consent** or **contractual nessessity**. 

## Right to Erasure / Right to be Forgotten
Data subjects may request erasure for the following reasons:

* The data is no longer necessary for the purpose
* If the processing is based on consent, and the consent is withdrawn
* If the processing is based on the controller's legitimate interest and the data subject objects
* When require dfor compliance with EU or member-state law
* If consent was given when the data subject was a child

There are the usual exemptions for national security, crime prevention and protection of other's rights and freedoms, compliance with EU or member-state law, public health purposes, establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and the public interest. Another valid exemption is the exercise of freedom of expression and information. 

If the controller has made the data public, they must also take reasonable steps to inform the other controllers which are processing the data to remove it (eg Google). 

## Restriction of Processing
Data subjects may request that their data stop being processed, but is still stored. This can provide an alternative to erasure if the storage is legally required, ensures the protection of another person's right, or is in the public interest. The GDPR does not set down a specific method for restriction, but one option is to simply flag it in the system.

Data subjects may request restriction of processing for the following reasons:

* The accuracy of the data is contested
* The processing is unlawful
* The data is not needed
* The data subject objects to the processing (see below)

Once restricted, processing may only begin again with Consent, or to protect another's rights, exercise or defend legal claims, or in the public interest.

## Right to Object to the processing of Personal Data
The data subject may object to the processing of personal data in the following situations:

* The processing is for Direct Marketing
* Processing is based on Public Interests or the Controller's Legisimate Interests
* Processing is for research or statistical purposes. This may be overridden by the public interest

## not to be Subject to Decisions based on Automated Processing
The data subject has the right not to be subject to decisions based soley on automated processing, including profiling (including cookies, web beacons and digital fingerprints) if the processing has a large impact or produces legal effects. Children should never be subject to these decisions. Subjects must be able to object, make their case to a human, and see the nature of the algorithm. 

There are exeptions for decisions authorised by EU or member-state law, processing nessecary to enter into/perform a contract (eg evaluating credit or insurance risk), decisions based on the data subject's explicit consent. Decisions based on special categories of data are generally prohibited. 


# Transparency
Data controllers must communicate with Data Subjects in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in a concise form. For example, if the audience includes children, it must be understandable by children.

This may be presented in 'layered' notices of up to three layers that provide increasing levels of information, so long as the sum of the documents meets legal requirements. It may also be delivered as a 'just-in-time' notice ahead of the information's use, and may also use standardized icons to assist with understanding. 

## Information Provision Obligations
If information is collected from an indirect source (such as scraping websites), it may require information to be provided after collection, but before processing. Notice is not required if the data subjects already have the information. 

Direct Collection:
* Data Subjects must have the identity and contact details of the Controller and DPO
* Purpose and legal basis of processing
* Recipients of the Personal Data
* Intention to transfer data to a third country or organisation
* Legal basis for intended international transfers
* Legitimate interests of the controller, if used
* Storage period
* Data Subjects' rights (To Withdraw Consent, Access Information, Restrict Processing, Lodge a Complaint with a DPA). Subject must also be informed that withdrawing consent doesn't affect the lawfulness of processing already done.
* If processing the data is a Statutory or contractual requirement
* Information about the use of automated decision-making

Indirect Collection:
* Data Subjects must be provided with the source of the data and the categories of personal data. This needs to be provided within 1 month or upon first communication with the data subject.
* All the other information required for Direct Collection

Exceptions: If the subject already has the information, if it's impossible or would require disproportionate effort, or it would renter impossible or seriously impair the purpose of the data processing. National or EU laws that require secrecy are also an exception.


# Cross Border Transfers
Personal Data can only be sent outside the EEA with an appropriate safeguard that guarantees the protection of that data. Controllers are obligated to notify data subjects of the intent to transfer personal data internationally, the safeguards being used to protect the data and if it is to a country with or without an adequacy decision. 

## Apropriate Safeguards
These are legal tools designed to ensure the protection of personal data outside the EEA. They are:
* Binding Corporate Rules
* Standard Contractual Clauses
* Approved codes of conduct and certification mechanisms (not defined yet)
* Ad hoc contractual clauses
* Reliance on international agreements (Privacy Shield)

All of these must have supervisory authority authorization. The SCCs are pre-authorized provided no changes are made.

## Adequacy Decisions
Transfers to Adequate countries do not require additional safeguards. Adequacy decisions are made by the European Commission. Decisions made under the Data Protection Directive will remain in force until amended.

## Derogaction
As a last resort, data can be transfered to a non-adequate, non-EEA country without a safeguard, with a derogation. These have been carried over from the Data Protection Directive, and are only for the following cases:

* Consent (difficult to achieve _informed_ consent, given the risks)
* For the Performance of a Contract (eg booking a hotel in a 3rd country)
* Public Interest
* Establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
* Vital Interests
* From a register of public information
* Legitimate interests of the controller - non-repetitive, and for a limited number of individuals. This is only for the protection of individual's rights, assessment and documentation, suitable safeguards and notification to the data subject and supervisory authority of the transfer.
