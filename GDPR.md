# Personal Data

GDPR does not apply to anonyimised data. Pseudonymous data, which has had some identifying information replaced with an identifier, is still governed by GDPR.

They do not exercise autonomy in deciding how the data is used and their activities must be transparent to the controller. Processing can include any operation performed on data, and does not soley apply to collection.

2. When data subjects are in the EU
3. The goods or services are offered in the EU
