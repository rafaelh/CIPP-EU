# CIPP-EU
These are my study notes for iapp's CIPP/EU privacy certification. These notes are intentionally brief, with the intention of being memorable and passing on key concepts rapidly. I would recommend the following reading order:

* [EU Data Protection Law](https://github.com/rafaelh/CIPP-EU/blob/master/EU-data-protection-law.md)
* [EU Institutions](https://github.com/rafaelh/CIPP-EU/blob/master/EU-institutions.md)
* [non-EU Institutions](https://github.com/rafaelh/CIPP-EU/blob/master/non-EU-institutions.md)

If you are doing the certification yourself, I recommend assembling your own version of notes like these - the process of creating them is more useful than reading them.
