# OECD Guidelines

Developed in 1980, the _OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder flows of Personal Data_ lays out basic rules for trans-border data flows and the protection of personal information, to help harmonize the laws between countries. They were prepared in close cooperation with the Council of Europe, and are __not legally binding__. They don't distinguish between automated and non-automated processing. The Principals are:

* **Collection Limitation**: Personal information must be collected fairly and lawfully and with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned

* **Data Quality**: Personal information must be relevant, complete, accurate and up to date

* **Purpose Specification**: The purpose for which the personal information is to be used must be specified at the time of collection, and any use must be compatible with that purpose

* **Use Limitation**: Any disclosure of personal information must be consistent with the purposes specified unless the individual has given consent or the data controller has the lawful authority to do so.

* **Security Safeguards**: Reasonable security safeguards must be taken against risks such as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of personal information

* **Openness**: There should be a general policy of openness with respect to the uses of personal information as well as the identity and location of the data controller

* **Individual Participation**: This sets out what an individual is entitled to recieve from a data contoller once they request their personal information. This has become one of the most important aspects of subsequent data protection legislation

* **Accountability**: A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures that ensure these principals
