# NON-EU INSTITUTIONS
These are NOT EU institutions

# The Council of Europe
The Council of Europe is made up of **47** member states (Including Uruguay and Mexico) and is not an EU institution. Being a member of the Council of Europe means the country is also bound by the previous rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, which has all the important judgements relating to privacy.

# The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
This court administers the European Convention on Human Rights, and Convention 108+. Located in Strasbourg, this court examines breaches of the Convention and ensures states in the Council of Europe comply with their obligations. Its rulings are binding on member states, and can require them to ammend laws. They can also issue advisory opinions concerning the interpretation of the Convention and the protocols.

_The ECHR is not a European Union Institution_, and has no enforcement rights. It is composed of an equal number of judges to the members of the Council of Europe, though they are independant of their nominating state.
