# DATA PROTECTION LAW

# Privacy is based on Human Rights
This is not an absolute right and necessity and proportionality may justify breaching an individual's privacy in the public interest. Data privacy originates in two main instruments:
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights
* European Convention on Human Rights

# Universal Declaration of Human Rights
A non-binding UN instrument which includes Privacy language, in 1948.

# European Convention on Human Rights ('the Convention')
In 1950, the Council of Europe invited states to sign the **European Convention on Human Rights**. The law only applies to member states, and is therefore referred to as a 'Closed Instrument'. All members of the Council of Europe are party to it. It is enforced by the Strasbourg **European Court of Human Rights**.

# Charter of Fundamenal Rights
Signed in 2000 by the presidents of the European Parliament and based on preceding laws, it consolidates fundamental rights applicable within the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon gave it binding legal effect in 2009. The privacy sections of it are:

1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her
2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate masis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independant authority

# The Treaty of Rome
Not a privacy agreement; this was the Treaty establishing the European Community, or EC Treaty.

# The Treaty of Lisbon
Signed in 2007 and took effect in 2009; its aim was to strengthen the core structures of the European Union to enable it to function more efficiently. It contains a provision which requires all institutions of the European Union to protect individuals when processing personal data. This treaty is significant because it enshrines human rights. The Treaty of Rome did not. It provides the following:

* Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private family life, home and communications
* Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning them
* Everyone has the right to have their affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the offices of the Union

Poland and the UK are not fully covered by this.

# Convention 108
Originally developped in 1981, the most recent version (Convention 108+) was signed Oct 10th, 2018 by 20 states, including the UK. The European Commission sees the protocol as a way of encourating "third countries" to adopt the basic tenants of GDPR.

It is a **Council of Europe** treaty, also known as the _'Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data'_. It has been updated to bring it into line with GDPR.

## Convention 108+ contents
It consists of three main parts:

### Chapter II - Substantive law provisions in the form of basic principals
1. Personal information undergoing automatic processing must be:
   a. Obtained and processed fairly and lawfully
   b. Stored for specified and legitimate purposes, and not used otherwise
   c. Adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes
   d. Accurate and where necessary, kept up to date
   e. Preserved in a form that permists identification of individuals for no longer than is required for the purpose for which the information is stored
2. Appropriate security measures must be taken against accidental destruction, alteration or access
3. Special categories of data (secual life, criminal convictions, etc) must not be processed automatically unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards
4. Individuals must have the right of communication, rectification and erasure
5. Exceptions are only allowed for a 'neccessary measure in a democratic society' like state security or criminal investigation.

### Chapter III - Special rules on trans-border data flows
1. If you are a signatory, you can't impose privacy rules on other signatories
2. A 2001 provision introduced the concept of 'adequate' countries who were not signatories

### Chapter IV - Mechanisms for Mutual Assistance and consultation between the parties
1. Signatories must have a Data Protection Authority, they must work with each other, and they must give assistance to individuals regarding their rights.

# The Data Protection Directive
This was replaced by the GDPR in the EU and places obligations on member states (where the GDPR is directly enforcable, with some local tailoring). It formed the Article 29 Working Party.

Convention 108 lays down principals and leaves implementation up to the signatory states. This has resulted in divergent national laws. To address this, the European Commission issued the 'Data Protection Directive' (85/46/EC), providing futher enforcable guidance. The EC can issue infraction proceedings against states who fail to remedy differences between countries.

Unlike the Council of Europe, the EU can't make stand-alone Human Rights laws, and must base them on specific provisions of the Treaty of Rome. For this reason the Data Protection Directive is based off the requirement to abolish internal EU barriers to the free movement of goods, which in turn requirest the internal movement of personal data.

Key directive concepts include 'Necessity' with regards to processing data lawfully. The directive also included manual 'filing system' data in the requirements for data protection, articulates 'special categories' of data, data subject rights, and requires the establishment of Data Protection Authorities in signatory countries.

The directive is currently under review and will be updated.
