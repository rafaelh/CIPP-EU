# Supervisory Authorities
Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) have the following responsibilities:

* Promoting awareness
* Conduct investigations
* Protect fundamental human rights
* Draw up annual reports
* Facilitate the free flow of personal data within the EU

Their powers fall into these three categories:

* Investigative (site visits, and requiring documentation)
* Corrective (including banning processing)
* Authorization and advisory

In multi-juristictional cases, the 'lead supervisory authority' is the primary regulator, which is located where the center of administration for the controller is. Under the EU's one-stop-shop rule only one DPA will investigate each issue. 

Chapter 7 of the GDPR provides mechanisms to assist DPAs cooperate, including:

* Cooperation
* Mutual assistance
* Joint operations
* Consistency mechanism
* Dispute resolution
* Urgency proceedure

### Enforcement
Enforcement can have multiple penalties:

* Fines
* Liabilities resulting from harm
* Member-state penalties

The fines follow a two tier system depending on the nature of the enfringement:

* 20m Euro or %4 of turnover: enfringement of GDPR principals, data subject rights, international transfers
* 10m Euro or %2 of turnover: most other enfringements, including security breaches
* or you may get a reprimand in certain less-serious circumstances

Factors involved in fines:
* Number of data subjects involved
* Whether the purpose limitation principal has been applied
* Damage suffered by the data subjects
* Duration of the infringement



## European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)
The EDPS oversees compliance with data protection law within the institutions of the European Union (Parliament and the European Commission), but national DPAs may also have jurisdiction in such matters.



## The European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
Formerly the Article 29 working party, which was established by the Data Protection Directive. It is and independant advisory body composed of representatives from the EU DPAs.

* Each of the 31 EEA members have a representative on the EDPB
* Each of the 28 member states have an active member on the EDPB (who can actively particpate)
* Presided over by a Chair who is elected by the EDPB representatives
* The EDPS and representatives of the European Commission also participate on the board, but without voting rights

The EDPB has the following purposes:

* Monitor for correct GDPR application
* Oversee the consistency mechanism
* Issue guidance and advice to the Commission
* Preside over the dispute-resolution process

The EDPB's opinions are not legally binding, but pre-empt how the insitutions of the EU will react.
