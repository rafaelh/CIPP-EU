# The ePrivacy Directive
Officially Directive 2002/58/EC, also known as the Cookie Directive or Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive. Whereas the GDPR regulates Personal Data, the ePrivacy Directive addresses the confidentiality of communicatiosn over public networks, setting out rules for:

* **Location data** - only to be processed with consent or if anonymised, and the subject must be informed beforehand and have the ability to opt out. Carriers may process location data to provide their service.

* **Content data** - needs to be protected and remain confidential. Member states are to ensure that listening, tapping, storage or other surveillance doesn't occur unlawfully.

* **Traffic data** - can only be used for limited purposes. Telecommunications companies can use it to convey communication and marketing, but only with the user's consent. Once there is no longer a need to keep traffic data, it must be erased. It can only be kept for purposes such as billing up to the statutory limit of account recievable. 

The ePrivacy Directive came into effect in 2002, and was updated in 2009. We are currently waiting on agreement for the ePrivacy _Regulation_ to come into effect.

Differences from GDPR:
* ePrivacy is currently a directive, not a regulation, so member states have flexibility in how they implement it. Regulations like GDPR become law everywhere once they come into force.
* ePrivacy is Lex Specialis to GDPR, meaning that regulators will look at it first rather than GDPR when dealing with an issue. It carries the same level of fines.
* Where GDPR is based on 6 legal bases, ePrivacy is soley based on Consent. 

Other Requirements of the Directive:
* Email addresses may not be used for marketing purposes without Opt-in. Companies who collect an email address in the context of the sale of a product or service may use the email for marketing as long as the subject can opt out. 

If data is travelling over an intranet, ePrivacy rules do not apply, since it isn't a public network. There are also the usual exceptions for national security, which constitutes lawful surveillance.
